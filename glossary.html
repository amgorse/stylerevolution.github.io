<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p class="about" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">The purpose of this color glossary is to provide English translations of French eighteenth-century terms related to color. Simple as such a glossary-cum-dictionary may sound this prototype is the first of its kind. What is perhaps not obvious to all is that color terminology, like many aspects of a language, come in and out of fashion, alter in meaning, and indeed, alter in use over time. The definitions and color terms listed in this dictionary have been congregated from use in the Journal des Dames et Des Modes and their correlating English definitions are a result of research using primary source dictionaries in an effort to best understand use and meanings of words used to describe color from 1795-1804 in France.</p>
