<h1>About</h1>
	<p class="about">This online exhibit is dedicated to what can be called the most radical and influential style magazine in European history, the <i>Journal des Dames et des Modes</i>. The French Revolution of 1789 promised that women and men could completely reinvent themselves, with the help of a total style transformation. Between 1797 and 1804, after the political crisis of the first revolutionary years and before Napoleon became Emperor, the <i>Journal des dames et des modes</i> showed all Europeans how to look, read, and entertain themselves as modern individuals. It rejected the dress rules and materials that had signaled static social rank in favor of mobile self-expression through consumer choice.</p>
	<p class="about">This site gives online access to the most inventive and radical Journal des Dames et des Modes fashion plates, those published between 1797 and 1804. For the first time, captions to the plates and their text descriptions are being transcribed and translated, systematically reuniting the magazine’s images with its texts. This site also provides urban, political, material, and nationally comparative contexts for the plates, along with a dedicated glossary. </p>
