<h1>About</h1>
	<p class="about">This online exhibit is dedicated to what can be called the most radical and influential style magazine in European history, the <i>Journal des Dames et des Modes</i>. The French Revolution of 1789 promised that women and men could completely reinvent themselves, with the help of a total style transformation. Between 1797 and 1804, after the political crisis of the first revolutionary years and before Napoleon became Emperor, the <i>Journal des dames et des modes</i> showed all Europeans how to look, read, and entertain themselves as modern individuals. It rejected the dress rules and materials that had signaled static social rank in favor of mobile self-expression through consumer choice.</p>
	<p class="about">A rare complete set of the <i>Journal</i>’s revolutionary 1797-1804 plates has recently been rediscovered at the Morgan Library, and digitized.</p>
