<h1>Paris vs. London</h1>
	<p class="about">Many of the fashions depicted in the <i>Journal des Dames et des Modes</i> from 1797-1804 are strikingly radical and uniquely Parisian. Comparing the <i>JDM</i> to fashion plates from British journals printed in London reinforces these claims, but also shows commonalities between the two warring countries. The infographic below (click to enlarge) draws comparisons between <i>JDM</i> and two British journals:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Gallery of Fashion: </i>Published from _ to _ by Nicholas Heideloff. Two plates featuring 3-4 figures appeared monthly with accompanying descriptions.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Magazine of Fashions of London and Paris: </i>Published from _ to _. Monthly...#figures. Almost every month included a plate titled "Parisian Fashions" that was a translation of plates from <i>JDM</i>
	</ul>
	<p class="about"> It is notable that these two journals only depicted women's fashions during this period, never men, and figures rarely appeared alone. Even when the <i>Fashions of London and Paris</i> copied <i>JDM</i> plates, they put two or more figures on the page - it would be highly improper for a woman to be out and about on her own!</p>
