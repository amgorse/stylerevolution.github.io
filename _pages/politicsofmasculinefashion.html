In 1789, in an attempt to put an end to the serious economic crisis that had afflicted France for twenty years, King Louis XVI decided to summon the States General, an assembly combining all the representatives of the nobility, clergy and people. French society had undergone deep changes in the course of the 18th century and there was great hope for political reform, and for the introduction of equality for all and an end to aristocratic privileges. These hopes were soon dashed however and the situation deteriorated. On 14 July Parisians rose up and stormed the imposing royal prison of La Bastille. It as the beginning of a major revolution that lasted several years.<br>After the abolition of the monarchy, in 1792, France experienced a period of political instability. The Republic that had just been proclaimed found it difficult to establish solid institutions. In 1799, a young general renowed for his victorious military campaigns took power: Napoleon Bonaparte, who crowned himself Emperor of the French and reigned over a large swathe of Europe for almost ten years.
