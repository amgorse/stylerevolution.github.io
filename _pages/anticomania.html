       <p>The French revolution instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. Particularly fashionable, was ‘anticomania’- a reimagining of worldly and antique styles- particularly those of Greek, Roman, and far East origins. In this plate, we see the impact of both the turban style as well as a "Lisbeth corset" so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favières and Grétry comic opera.</p>

      <p>Echos of the Terror manifested in fashion through the ceinture a la victime, or 'victim's belt." A bright red sash was wrapped round the torso and shoulders- a macabre reminder of the violence and bloodshed which had so recently taken place.</p>
