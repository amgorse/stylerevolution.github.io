       <p>The first edition of the <i>Journal des Dames et des Modes</i> was released on March 20, 1797 by Jean-Baptiste Sellèque and Pierre de La Mésangère. Originally composed of 8 text pages plus 1 or 2 fashion engravings, a new <i>Journal</i> was released about every 5 days. Parisian readers could subscribe to the publication at either the <i>Journal’s</i> office for the cost of 30 francs per year, 16 francs per 6 months, and 9 francs per quarter in 1798.
       That the <i>Journal’s</i> production required the collaborative efforts of workers in many different trades meant that the sites of its creation were located throughout Paris. This map visualizes the movement of the <i>Journal</i> and its ideas throughout Revolutionary Paris, indicating where the offices were located, where it was printed, and where it was available to purchase. </p>

    <h2>Fashionable Spots</h2>

       <p>This map documents the fashion hotspots mentioned on 38 individual plates of the <i>Journal des Dames et des Modes</i>. In the earliest and most radical years of the <i>Journal</i>, 1797-1798, these individual plates cite 18 specific locations in Paris where the fashions illustrated were seen. Unlike any other fashion plates from the period, these plates depict women alone in the streets and public spaces of Paris.
       The locations mentioned by the <i>Journal</i> are mainly theaters and parks—public spaces of spectacle and display concentrated around the northwestern part of Paris. While a few of these places can still be seen today, many have disappeared. By reconstructing the relationship between these spaces, we are able to better understand the proximity of these places of fashionable sociability in Revolutionary Paris.</p>
