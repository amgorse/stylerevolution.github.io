<h1>Supporting the Revolution: Stays, Corsets, and Bodies</h1>
<p>Clothing carries the weight of dense social information- through it, the wearer conveys messages about not just class, status, and wealth; but also of style, taste, and personal expression. From this expression, much is revealed about the society in which these styles flourish, and the dominant social philosophies of their time.</p>

    <h2>Origin of stays</h2>
       <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/corsets/stays.png" alt="Stays" width="50%"/>
       <p>The foundations of 18th century French women’s clothing had been built upon the use of architecturally complex underpinnings of petticoats, panniers, and stays. These structures were typically rigid and inflexible, and were constructed using stiffening tools such as whalebone (baleen), reed, and metal. The name stays indicates exactly the original intention of the clothing to which it is applied; but unfortunately something more than mere support has been sought after at various times since the classic period to which the beginnings of stays may be traced.</p>
