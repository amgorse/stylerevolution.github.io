<h1>The Persistence of Color</h1>
<div><br>
    <p class="about">This glossary provides English translations of French color terms.  It is the first of its kind, perhaps because it is not as simple a tool as it seems. Words for color come in and out of fashion.  Their meaning and use alters over time and from place to place. To counteract these problems, we have here only translated words that appear in the captions and text of one context, seven years of the Journal des Dames et des Modes, and made every effort to use period dictionaries to locate meanings in use between 1797 and 1804.</p><br>
