<h1>Supporting a Revolution: Underpinnings or the lack thereof</h1>
<p>Clothing carries the weight of dense social information- through it, the wearer conveys messages about not just class, status, and wealth; but also of style, taste, and personal expression. From this expression, much is revealed about the society in which these styles flourish, and the dominant social philosophies and values of their time. </p>

    <h2>No More Underwear!</h2>
       <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/stays.png" alt="stays" width="50%"/>
       <p>The foundations of 18th century French women’s clothing had been built upon the use of architecturally complex underpinnings of petticoats, panniers, pads, and stays. These substructures were typically rigid and inflexible, and were constructed using stiffening tools such as whalebone (baleen), reed, and metal. The name stays indicates exactly the original intention of the clothing to which it is applied. However, a fashion schism would free women from these constricting garmets in the mid-1790's and usher in an unexpectedly anachronistic display of the female form.

A confluence of multiple factors contributed to a necessity for this change, but most influential was the French revolution, which instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women - styles which sought to break free from the ways of the Ancien Régime. Proposals for the new revolutionary uniform called to abolish stays, but how were women to remain supported and simultaneously break free? </p>

     <h2>Innovations of materials, styles, & silhouettes</h2>
       	 <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/metalelastique.png" alt="metalelastique" width="50%"/>
	    <p>The empire silhouette changed everything. As the focus moved to the underbust, there was no longer a need for stays to winnow away the waist. The popular fascination with all things antique directly impacted women's clothing, and as their fashions changed, so did their underwear. These new styles and shapes strove to achieve a “natural” silhouette, which required new underpinnings and new methods of constuction. One such technology is the advent of "metal elastique," a rigid, yet expandable, material made from tightly coiled metal wires. This clever application of mechanical materials to undergarments can be attributed to the 1763 patent of the coiled spring, and can also be seen used in jewelry depicted in the <i>Journal</i>.</p>

    <h2>Corset styles</h2>

       <p>The French revolution instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. In this plate, we see the "Lisbeth corset" so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favières and Grétry comic opera. This style, though dubbed a 'corset' by the <i>Journal</i>, was a term somewhat interchangable with 'bodice' and served a more decorative purpose, rather than that of a support garment.</p>

     <p>Women's underpinnings began to migrate from underclothing to outerclothing. </p>

     <h2>A Swing in Moral Attitudes</h2>

      <p>
        A total rejection of Jacobian puritanism and conventional morality, so expected of 
        symbols of social rules that denoted status
      As prudishness disappeared, so did women's underpinnings. The once excessive petticoats and stays were abandonned. The reduction in superfluous undergarments revealed the true shape of a woman's body, rather than 

    However, this brief moment of anatomical freedom was short-lived and complicated underpinning were back in full force by the 1820's.</p>
