    <h2>No More Underwear!</h2>

       <p>The foundations of 18th century French women’s clothing had been built upon the use of architecturally complex underpinnings of petticoats, panniers, pads, and stays. These substructures were typically rigid and inflexible and were constructed using stiffening tools such as whalebone (baleen), reed, and metal. The name stays indicates exactly the original intention of the clothing to which it is applied. However, a fashion schism would free women from these constricting garments in the mid-1790's and usher in an unexpectedly anachronistic display of the female form.
        <img style="float: left; margin: 15px 20px 20px 0px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/1750frenchstays.jpg" alt="1750 french stays" align="left" width="50%"/>In the space of a scant two years women suddenly altered their long-held habits of wearing the standard complex system of underpinnings. A confluence of multiple factors contributed to a necessity for this change, but most influential was the French revolution, which abandoned the habits of the Ancien Régime and instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. There were even proposals for a new revolutionary uniform for citizens, which called for the total abolishing of stays.</p>

     <h2>Innovations in materials, styles, & silhouettes</h2>
       	 <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/metalelastique.png" alt="metalelastique" width="50%"/>
	    <p>The popularity of classical silhouettes changed everything. As the focus moved to the underbust, there was no longer a need for stays to winnow away the waist. The popular fascination with all things antique directly impacted women's clothing, and as their fashions changed, so did their underwear. These new styles and shapes strove to achieve a “natural” silhouette, which required underpinnings which would not deform a women's natural shape. This called for new materials and advances in construction. One such technology is the advent of "metal elastique," a rigid, yet expandable material made from tightly coiled metal wires. This clever application of mechanical materials to undergarments can be attributed to the 1763 patent of the coiled spring, and can also be seen used in jewelry depicted in the <i>Journal</i>.</p>

    <h2>Corset styles</h2>
       <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/lisbethcorset.png" alt="lisbethcorset" width="50%"/>
       <p>The French revolution instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. Inspiration changed quickly and was taken from whatever novelty was trending at the moment. Whether it was political, historical, or theatrical- nothing was off limits to influence women's dress. In this plate, we see the "Lisbeth corset" so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favières and Grétry comic opera. <br><br>
      <img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/bodice.png" alt="bodice" width="50%"/>  These styles, though dubbed as 'corsets' by the <i>Journal</i>, were terms used somewhat interchangeably with 'bodice' and served more decorative purposes, rather than as support garments. Soon, women's underpinnings began to migrate from underclothing to outer clothing. </p>

     <h2>A Swing in Moral Attitudes</h2>
         <img style="float: right; margin-bottom: 0;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/cp154.png" alt="nocorsets" width="50%"/>
      <p>
        A change in moral attitudes occurred which resulted in a total rejection of  conventional morality. Clothing which acted as social signifiers of status and moral 'uprightness' were discarded. As prudishness disappeared, so did women's underpinnings. The once excessive petticoats and stays were abandoned. The reduction in superfluous undergarments coupled with popular diaphanous mull and muslin fabrics revealed the true shape and details of a woman's body.</p>

      <br><br><p>The <i>Journal</i> did not shy away from depicting the consequences of these new fashions and their impact throughout Europe would have been formidable. However, this brief moment of emancipated sexuality was short-lived and restrictive underpinnings were back in full force by the 1820's.</p>
