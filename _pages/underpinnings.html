<h1>Supporting the Revolution: Underpinnings or the lack thereof</h1>
<p>Clothing carries the weight of dense social information- through it, the wearer conveys messages about not just class, status, and wealth; but also of style, taste, and personal expression. From this expression, much is revealed about the society in which these styles flourish, and the dominant social philosophies of their time.</p>

    <h2>Origin of Stays</h2>
       <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jm/stays.png" alt="stays" width="50%"/>
       <p>The foundations of 18th century French women’s clothing had been built upon the use of architecturally complex underpinnings of petticoats, panniers, and stays. These structures were typically rigid and inflexible, and were constructed using stiffening tools such as whalebone (baleen), reed, and metal. The name stays indicates exactly the original intention of the clothing to which it is applied; but unfortunately something more than mere support has been sought after at various times since the classic period to which the beginnings of stays may be traced.</p>

       <h2>A time of Transition</h2>
       <p>A confluence of multiple factors contributed to a necessity for change. A proposals for the new revolutionary uniform called to abolish stays - but how were women to remain supported? Transitional stays </p>

     <h2>Innovations of materials, styles, & silhouettes</h2>

	    <p> New styles and shapes evolved to achieve a “natural” silhouette, which required new underpinnings and new methods of constuction. One such technology is the advent of "metal elastique," a rigid, yet expandable, material made from tightly coiled metal wires. This clever application of mechanical materials to undergarments can be attributed to the 1763 patent of the coiled spring, and can also be seen used in jewelry depicted in the <i>Journal</i>.</p>

    <h2>Corset styles</h2>

       <p>The French revolution instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. In this plate, we see the "Lisbeth corset" so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favières and Grétry comic opera. This style, though dubbed a 'corset' by the <i>Journal</i> appears to be more of a bodice than an actual support garment.</p>

      <p>As prudishness disappeared, so did women's underpinnings. The once excessive petticoats and stays were abandonned. The reduction in superfluous undergarments revealed the true shape of a woman's body, rather than </p>
