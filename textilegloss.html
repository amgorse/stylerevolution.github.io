<h1>Textile & Materials Glossary</h1>

<div><br>
    <p class="about">This textile glossary brings together a broad range of vocabulary relating to French Directory fashion plates such as those found in the Journal des Dames et des Modes. While by no means an exhaustive list, the purpose of this glossary is to provide quick reference material for those interested in reading the plate captions and descriptions, as well as those who wish to visually correlate the fashions found in the plates with contemporary textile samples and designs. Please note that some textile terminology changed over time according to location, language or continued usage and thus can have inconsistent meanings. Discrepancies can be cross-referenced from the JDM references section or from ARTFL's online dictionary database.</p><br>
