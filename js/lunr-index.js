The French Revolution of 1789 promised that women and men could completely reinvent themselves, with the help of a total style transformation. Between 1797 and 1804, after the political crisis of the first revolutionary years and before Napoleon became Emperor, the Journal des dames et des modes showed all Europeans how to look, read, and entertain themselves as modern individuals. It rejected the dress rules and materials that had signaled static social rank in favor of mobile self-expression through consumer choice.\n\tThis site gives online access to the most inventive and radical Journal des Dames et des Modes fashion plates, those published between 1797 and 1804. For the first time, captions to the plates and their text descriptions are being transcribed and translated, systematically reuniting the magazine’s images with its texts. This site also provides urban, political, material, and nationally comparative contexts for the plates, along with a dedicated glossary. \n\n\n\tCredits\n\tA rare complete set of the Journal’s revolutionary 1797-1804 plates has recently been rediscovered at the Morgan Library, and digitized.

Originally composed of 8 text pages plus 1 or 2 fashion engravings, a new Journal was released about every 5 days. Parisian readers could subscribe to the publication at either the Journal’s office for the cost of 30 francs per year, 16 francs per 6 months, and 9 francs per quarter in 1798.\n       That the Journal’s production required the collaborative efforts of workers in many different trades meant that the sites of its creation were located throughout Paris. This map visualizes the movement of the Journal and its ideas throughout Revolutionary Paris, indicating where the offices were located, where it was printed, and where it was available to purchase. \n       \n\n\n    Fashionable Spots\n       \n       This map documents the fashion hotspots mentioned on 38 individual plates of the Journal des Dames et des Modes. In the earliest and most radical years of the Journal, 1797-1798, these individual plates cite 18 specific locations in Paris where the fashions illustrated were seen. Unlike any other fashion plates from the period, these plates depict women alone in the streets and public spaces of Paris.\n       The locations mentioned by the Journal are mainly theaters and parks—public spaces of spectacle and display concentrated around the northwestern part of Paris. While a few of these places can still be seen today, many have disappeared. By reconstructing the relationship between these spaces, we are able to better understand the proximity of these places of fashionable sociability in Revolutionary Paris.\n       \n\nInteractive Map of Paris\n\n\n"});

Comparing JDM plates to fashions from British journals printed in London reinforces these claims, but also shows commonalities between the two warring countries. The infographic below (click to enlarge) draws comparisons between JDM and two British journals:\n\t\n\t\tGallery of Fashion: Published from 1794 to 1803 by Nicholas Heideloff. Two plates featuring 1-3 figures each appeared monthly with accompanying descriptions.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Fashions of London and Paris: Published monthly from 1798 to 1806 with 2-3 plates of London fashions. Almost every month also included a plate titled 'Parisian Fashions' that directly copied fashions from JDM with minor changes.\n\t\n\t It is notable that British fashion plates only depicted women's fashions during this period, never men, and figures rarely appeared alone. Even when The Fashions of London and Paris copied JDM plates, they arranged two or more figures on the page - it would be highly improper for a woman to be out and about on her own!\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n"});

French society had undergone deep changes in the course of the 18th century and there was great hope for political reform, and for the introduction of equality for all and an end to aristocratic privileges. These hopes were soon dashed however and the situation deteriorated. On 14 July Parisians rose up and stormed the imposing royal prison of La Bastille. It as the beginning of a major revolution that lasted several years.After the abolition of the monarchy, in 1792, France experienced a period of political instability. The Republic that had just been proclaimed found it difficult to establish solid institutions.

The French Revolution of 1789 promised that women and men could completely reinvent themselves, with the help of a total style transformation. Between 1797 and 1804, after the political crisis of the first revolutionary years and before Napoleon became Emperor, the Journal des dames et des modes showed all Europeans how to look, read, and entertain themselves as modern individuals. It rejected the dress rules and materials that had signaled static social rank in favor of mobile self-expression through consumer choice.\n\tThis site gives online access to the most inventive and radical Journal des Dames et des Modes fashion plates, those published between 1797 and 1804. For the first time, captions to the plates and their text descriptions are being transcribed and translated, systematically reuniting the magazine’s images with its texts. This site also provides urban, political, material, and nationally comparative contexts for the plates, along with a dedicated glossary. \n\n\n\tCredits\n\tA rare complete set of the Journal’s revolutionary 1797-1804 plates has recently been rediscovered at the Morgan Library, and digitized.

Originally composed of 8 text pages plus 1 or 2 fashion engravings, a new Journal was released about every 5 days. Parisian readers could subscribe to the publication at either the Journal’s office for the cost of 30 francs per year, 16 francs per 6 months, and 9 francs per quarter in 1798.\n       That the Journal’s production required the collaborative efforts of workers in many different trades meant that the sites of its creation were located throughout Paris. This map visualizes the movement of the Journal and its ideas throughout Revolutionary Paris, indicating where the offices were located, where it was printed, and where it was available to purchase. \n       \n\n\n    Fashionable Spots\n       \n       This map documents the fashion hotspots mentioned on 38 individual plates of the Journal des Dames et des Modes. In the earliest and most radical years of the Journal, 1797-1798, these individual plates cite 18 specific locations in Paris where the fashions illustrated were seen. Unlike any other fashion plates from the period, these plates depict women alone in the streets and public spaces of Paris.\n       The locations mentioned by the Journal are mainly theaters and parks—public spaces of spectacle and display concentrated around the northwestern part of Paris. While a few of these places can still be seen today, many have disappeared. By reconstructing the relationship between these spaces, we are able to better understand the proximity of these places of fashionable sociability in Revolutionary Paris.\n       \n\nInteractive Map of Paris\n\n\n"},

Comparing JDM plates to fashions from British journals printed in London reinforces these claims, but also shows commonalities between the two warring countries. The infographic below (click to enlarge) draws comparisons between JDM and two British journals:\n\t\n\t\tGallery of Fashion: Published from 1794 to 1803 by Nicholas Heideloff. Two plates featuring 1-3 figures each appeared monthly with accompanying descriptions.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Fashions of London and Paris: Published monthly from 1798 to 1806 with 2-3 plates of London fashions. Almost every month also included a plate titled 'Parisian Fashions' that directly copied fashions from JDM with minor changes.\n\t\n\t It is notable that British fashion plates only depicted women's fashions during this period, never men, and figures rarely appeared alone. Even when The Fashions of London and Paris copied JDM plates, they arranged two or more figures on the page - it would be highly improper for a woman to be out and about on her own!\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n"},

To counteract these problems, we have here only translated words that appear in the captions and text of one context, seven years of the Journal des Dames et des Modes, and made every effort to use period dictionaries to locate meanings in use between 1797 and 1804.\n  \n\n  \n    \n      {% for letter in letters %}\n        {{ letter | upcase }}{% unless forloop.last %}&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;{% endunless %}\n      {% endfor %}\n    \n  \n\n  \n    {% for letter in letters %}\n    {{ letter | upcase }}\n  \t\n  \t\t\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\n      {% for color in colors %}\n        {% assign color_letter = color.name | slice: 0 | downcase %}\n        {% if color_letter == letter %}\n      \t\t\n      \t\t\t\n      \t\t\t{{ color.name }}{{ color.description }}\n      \t\t\n        {% endif %}\n      {% endfor %}\n    \n    {% endfor %}\n  \n\n"},

French society had undergone deep changes in the course of the 18th century and there was great hope for political reform, and for the introduction of equality for all and an end to aristocratic privileges. These hopes were soon dashed however and the situation deteriorated. On 14 July Parisians rose up and stormed the imposing royal prison of La Bastille. It as the beginning of a major revolution that lasted several years.After the abolition of the monarchy, in 1792, France experienced a period of political instability.
