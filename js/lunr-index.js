The French Revolution of 1789 promised that all people could reinvent themselves. Between 1797 and 1804, after the political crisis of the first revolutionary years subsided, and before Napoleon demanded that women?s clothing become more conservative, the  Journal des dames et des modes  offered Europeans a startlingly new way to dress. It rejected the rules, shapes, and materials that had signaled static social rank in favor of mobile self-expression through consumer choice. This dramatic experiment in individualism freed men to dress as they have ever since, and for a brief time liberated women too.    Here you will find, online for the first time, all the  Journal des dames et des modes  plates from the magazine?s most surprising years, 1797-1804, together with their transcribed and translated captions.  The digital images were made from an extremely rare, complete set of the engravings, in exceptionally good condition, belonging to the Morgan Library. Digital work on the vocabulary, text descriptions, locations, patterns, and historical context of the plates has been begun by a faculty-student team based at Columbia University, and is ongoing.       Credits    A rare complete set of the  Journal ?s revolutionary 1797-1804 plates has recently been rediscovered at the Morgan Library, and digitized.

Parisian readers could subscribe for the cost of 30 francs per year, 16 francs per 6 months, and 9 francs per quarter in 1798.

In the earliest and most radical years of the JDM, 1797-1798, these 38 plates cite 18 specific locations in Paris where the fashions illustrated were seen. Unlike any other fashion plates from the period, these depict women alone in urban streets and public spaces. The locations mentioned by the JDM are mainly theaters and parks?spaces of spectacle and display concentrated in the northwestern part of the city. While a few of these places survive, many have disappeared. The map allows us to see how close these places were to each other, and to the offices of the JDM, forming a network of fashionable sociability in revolutionary Paris.

Comparing JDM plates to fashions from British journals printed in London reinforces these claims, but also shows commonalities between the two warring countries. The infographic below ( click to enlarge ) draws comparisons between JDM and two British journals:         Gallery of Fashion:  Published from 1794 to 1803 by Nicholas Heideloff. Two plates featuring 1-3 figures each appeared monthly with accompanying descriptions.            The Fashions of London and Paris:  Published monthly from 1798 to 1806 with 2-3 plates of London fashions. Almost every month also included a plate titled 'Parisian Fashions' that directly copied fashions from the JDM with minor changes.        It is notable that fashion plates from these two British journals only depicted women's fashions during this period, never men, and the female figures rarely appeared alone. Even when  The Fashions of London and Paris  copied JDM plates, they arranged two or more figures on the page - it would be highly improper for a woman to be out and about on her own!                     All images of the  Gallery of Fashion  are from the collection of the  Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin .

French society had undergone deep changes in the course of the 18th century and there was great hope for political reform, and for the introduction of equality for all and an end to aristocratic privileges. These hopes were soon dashed however and the situation deteriorated. On 14 July Parisians rose up and stormed the imposing royal prison of La Bastille. It as the beginning of a major revolution that lasted several years. After the abolition of the monarchy, in 1792, France experienced a period of political instability. The Republic that had just been proclaimed found it difficult to establish solid institutions. In 1799, a young general renowed for his victorious military campaigns took power: Napoleon Bonaparte, who crowned himself Emperor of the French and reigned over a large swathe of Europe for almost ten years.

index.addDoc({"lunr_id":152,"link":"{{ site.baseurl }}/underpinnings/","title":"Underpinnings or the lack thereof","student":"","content":"   Supporting a Revolution: Underpinnings or the lack thereof   Clothing carries the weight of dense social information- through it, the wearer conveys messages about not just class, status, and wealth; but also of style, taste, and personal expression. From this expression, much is revealed about the society in which these styles flourish, and the dominant social philosophies and values of their time.                  No More Underwear!                   The foundations of 18th century French women?s clothing had been built upon the use of architecturally complex underpinnings of petticoats, panniers, pads, and stays. These substructures were typically rigid and inflexible, and were constructed using stiffening tools such as whalebone (baleen), reed, and metal. The name stays indicates exactly the original intention of the clothing to which it is applied. However, a fashion schism would free women from these constricting garmets in the mid-1790's and usher in an unexpectedly anachronistic display of the female form.          In the space of a scant two years women suddenly altered their long-held habits of wearing the standard complex system of underpinnings. A confluence of multiple factors contributed to a necessity for this change, but most influential was the French revolution, which abandoned the habits of the Ancien Regime and instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. There were even proposals for a new revolutionary uniform for citizens, which called for the total abolishing of stays.                         Innovations of materials, styles, & silhouettes                   The empire silhouette changed everything. As the focus moved to the underbust, there was no longer a need for stays to winnow away the waist. The popular fascination with all things antique directly impacted women's clothing, and as their fashions changed, so did their underwear. These new styles and shapes strove to achieve a ?natural? silhouette, which required underpinnings which would not deform a women's natural shape. This called for new materials and advances in constuction. One such technology is the advent of 'metal elastique,' a rigid, yet expandable, material made from tightly coiled metal wires. This clever application of mechanical materials to undergarments can be attributed to the 1763 patent of the coiled spring, and can also be seen used in jewelry depicted in the  Journal .                     Corset styles                   The French revolution instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. Inspiration changed quickly and was taken from whatever novelty was trending at the moment. Whether it was political, historical, or theatrical- nothing was off limits to infleunce women's dress. In this plate, we see the 'Lisbeth corset' so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favieres and Gretry comic opera.             These styles, though dubbed a 'corset' by the  Journal , was a term somewhat interchangable with 'bodice' and served a more decorative purpose, rather than that of a support garment. Soon, women's underpinnings began to migrate from underclothing to outerclothing.                              A Swing in Moral Attitudes                             A change in moral attitudes occurred which resulted in a total rejection of Jacobian puritanism and conventional morality. Clothing which acted as social signifiers of status and moral 'uprightness' were discarded. As prudishness disappeared, so did women's underpinnings. The once excessive petticoats and stays were abandonned. The reduction in superfluous undergarments coupled with popular diaphanous mull and muslin fabrics revealed the true shape and details of a woman's body.                   The  Journal  did not shy away from depicting the consequences of these new fashions and their impact throughout Europe would have been formidable. However, this brief moment of emancipiated sexuality was short-lived and restrictive underpinning were back in full force by the 1820's.

{"lunr_id":134,"link":"{{ site.baseurl }}/about/","title":"About","student":"","content":"   About    This project is dedicated to the world?s most original and influential style magazine,the  Journal des dames et des modes.  The French Revolution of 1789 promised that all people could reinvent themselves. Between 1797 and 1804, after the political crisis of the first revolutionary years subsided, and before Napoleon demanded that women?s clothing become more conservative, the  Journal des dames et des modes  offered Europeans a startlingly new way to dress. It rejected the rules, shapes, and materials that had signaled static social rank in favor of mobile self-expression through consumer choice. This dramatic experiment in individualism freed men to dress as they have ever since, and for a brief time liberated women too.    Here you will find, online for the first time, all the  Journal des dames et des modes  plates from the magazine?s most surprising years, 1797-1804, together with their transcribed and translated captions.  The digital images were made from an extremely rare, complete set of the engravings, in exceptionally good condition, belonging to the Morgan Library. Digital work on the vocabulary, text descriptions, locations, patterns, and historical context of the plates has been begun by a faculty-student team based at Columbia University, and is ongoing.       Credits    A rare complete set of the  Journal ?s revolutionary 1797-1804 plates has recently been rediscovered at the Morgan Library, and digitized.

Originally composed of 8 text pages plus 1 or 2 fashion engravings, a new issue of the  Journal  appeared about every 5 days. Parisian readers could subscribe for the cost of 30 francs per year, 16 francs per 6 months, and 9 francs per quarter in 1798. Because the  Journal's  production required the collaborative efforts of workers in many different trades, it was created in several places. This map visualizes where the  Journal's  offices were located, where it was printed, and where it was available to purchase.                   Fashionable Spots                   This map documents the fashion hotspots named in captions to  Journal des dames et des modes  plates. In the earliest and most radical years of the JDM, 1797-1798, these 38 plates cite 18 specific locations in Paris where the fashions illustrated were seen. Unlike any other fashion plates from the period, these depict women alone in urban streets and public spaces. The locations mentioned by the JDM are mainly theaters and parks?spaces of spectacle and display concentrated in the northwestern part of the city. While a few of these places survive, many have disappeared. The map allows us to see how close these places were to each other, and to the offices of the JDM, forming a network of fashionable sociability in revolutionary Paris.

Comparing JDM plates to fashions from British journals printed in London reinforces these claims, but also shows commonalities between the two warring countries. The infographic below ( click to enlarge ) draws comparisons between JDM and two British journals:         Gallery of Fashion:  Published from 1794 to 1803 by Nicholas Heideloff. Two plates featuring 1-3 figures each appeared monthly with accompanying descriptions.            The Fashions of London and Paris:  Published monthly from 1798 to 1806 with 2-3 plates of London fashions. Almost every month also included a plate titled 'Parisian Fashions' that directly copied fashions from the JDM with minor changes.        It is notable that fashion plates from these two British journals only depicted women's fashions during this period, never men, and the female figures rarely appeared alone. Even when  The Fashions of London and Paris  copied JDM plates, they arranged two or more figures on the page - it would be highly improper for a woman to be out and about on her own!

French society had undergone deep changes in the course of the 18th century and there was great hope for political reform, and for the introduction of equality for all and an end to aristocratic privileges. These hopes were soon dashed however and the situation deteriorated. On 14 July Parisians rose up and stormed the imposing royal prison of La Bastille. It as the beginning of a major revolution that lasted several years. After the abolition of the monarchy, in 1792, France experienced a period of political instability. The Republic that had just been proclaimed found it difficult to establish solid institutions. In 1799, a young general renowed for his victorious military campaigns took power: Napoleon Bonaparte, who crowned himself Emperor of the French and reigned over a large swathe of Europe for almost ten years.

{"lunr_id":152,"link":"{{ site.baseurl }}/underpinnings/","title":"Underpinnings or the lack thereof","student":"","content":"   Supporting a Revolution: Underpinnings or the lack thereof   Clothing carries the weight of dense social information- through it, the wearer conveys messages about not just class, status, and wealth; but also of style, taste, and personal expression. From this expression, much is revealed about the society in which these styles flourish, and the dominant social philosophies and values of their time.                  No More Underwear!                   The foundations of 18th century French women?s clothing had been built upon the use of architecturally complex underpinnings of petticoats, panniers, pads, and stays. These substructures were typically rigid and inflexible, and were constructed using stiffening tools such as whalebone (baleen), reed, and metal. The name stays indicates exactly the original intention of the clothing to which it is applied. However, a fashion schism would free women from these constricting garmets in the mid-1790's and usher in an unexpectedly anachronistic display of the female form.          In the space of a scant two years women suddenly altered their long-held habits of wearing the standard complex system of underpinnings. A confluence of multiple factors contributed to a necessity for this change, but most influential was the French revolution, which abandoned the habits of the Ancien Regime and instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. There were even proposals for a new revolutionary uniform for citizens, which called for the total abolishing of stays.                         Innovations of materials, styles, & silhouettes                   The empire silhouette changed everything. As the focus moved to the underbust, there was no longer a need for stays to winnow away the waist. The popular fascination with all things antique directly impacted women's clothing, and as their fashions changed, so did their underwear. These new styles and shapes strove to achieve a ?natural? silhouette, which required underpinnings which would not deform a women's natural shape. This called for new materials and advances in constuction. One such technology is the advent of 'metal elastique,' a rigid, yet expandable, material made from tightly coiled metal wires. This clever application of mechanical materials to undergarments can be attributed to the 1763 patent of the coiled spring, and can also be seen used in jewelry depicted in the  Journal .                     Corset styles                   The French revolution instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. Inspiration changed quickly and was taken from whatever novelty was trending at the moment. Whether it was political, historical, or theatrical- nothing was off limits to infleunce women's dress. In this plate, we see the 'Lisbeth corset' so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favieres and Gretry comic opera.             These styles, though dubbed a 'corset' by the  Journal , was a term somewhat interchangable with 'bodice' and served a more decorative purpose, rather than that of a support garment. Soon, women's underpinnings began to migrate from underclothing to outerclothing.                              A Swing in Moral Attitudes                             A change in moral attitudes occurred which resulted in a total rejection of Jacobian puritanism and conventional morality. Clothing which acted as social signifiers of status and moral 'uprightness' were discarded. As prudishness disappeared, so did women's underpinnings. The once excessive petticoats and stays were abandonned. The reduction in superfluous undergarments coupled with popular diaphanous mull and muslin fabrics revealed the true shape and details of a woman's body.                   The  Journal  did not shy away from depicting the consequences of these new fashions and their impact throughout Europe would have been formidable. However, this brief moment of emancipiated sexuality was short-lived and restrictive underpinning were back in full force by the 1820's.
