    "content": " Mapping theJournal des dames et des modes Interactive Map of Paris Printing and Selling the Journal The first edition of the Journal des dames et des modes was released on March 20, 1797 by Jean-Baptiste Selleque and Pierre de La Mesangere. Originally composed of 8 text pages plus 1 or 2 fashion engravings, a new issue of the Journal appeared about every 5 days. Parisian readers could subscribe for the cost of 30 francs per year, 16 francs per 6 months, and 9 francs per quarter in 1798. Because the Journal's production required the collaborative efforts of workers in many different trades, it was created in several places. This map visualizes where the Journal's offices were located, where it was printed, and where it was available to purchase. Fashionable Spots This map documents the fashion hotspots named in captions to Journal des dames et des modes plates. In the earliest and most radical years of the JDM, 1797-1798, these 38 plates cite 18 specific locations in Paris where the fashions illustrated were seen. Unlike any other fashion plates from the period, these depict women alone in urban streets and public spaces. The locations mentioned by the JDM are mainly theaters and parks—spaces of spectacle and display concentrated in the northwestern part of the city. While a few of these places survive, many have disappeared. The map allows us to see how close these places were to each other, and to the offices of the JDM, forming a network of fashionable sociability in revolutionary Paris. "

    "content": " The Persistence of Color This color glossary provides English translations of French late eighteenth-century terms related to color. Words for color, like many aspects of a language, come in and out of fashion, and alter in meaning or use. In order to find the meanings of color words in use between 1797 and 1804, period dictionaries and textile handbooks or sample-books were consulted, as well as an English fashion magazine whose plate descriptions are bilingual, the Miroir de la Mode. {{ letter | upcase }} {{ letter | upcase }} {{ color.name }}{{ color.description }} Alzan(e) Amaranthe Argent Aureus Aurore Azure Blanc Bleu Bleu Clair Bleu Celeste Bleu Turquin Bleu Violet Blond Dore Blond(e) Bronzer Brun/brunette Caerulus Carmin(e) Carnation Chamois Chatain Citrin(e) Coquelicot Cromoisy/Cramoisy Cumatilis Cyaneus Gris Gris Dauphin Gris de Lin Gros Bleu Incarnadin Jay/Jais blanc Jaune-Dore Jonquille Lilas Lilas Clair Lilas Fonce Marmote Mordore Murinus Nacarat Noir Or Ponceau Porcelaine Pourpre Pourpre Clair Rose/Rose Rouge Ruby Clair Ruby Fonce Souci Tricolor Verd/vert Vermeille Vert Brun Vert Celadon Vert Gai Vert Pistache Vert Pomme Vert de Mer Vert d’Emeraude Violet a sorrel or chestnut brown color deep bluish-red, a shade of red named after the amaranth plant silver or of silver color term used to describe gold color yellow color with light red tones a blue mineral; a blue color, commonly called (pendant le XVIII siecle) bleu celeste white blue; sky color light blue a saturated bright blue turquoise blue a violet which has strong blue undertones flaxen, light yellowish color fair or light honey color the color of cast copper or brass, sometime dark brown of a brown color cerulean blue, deep/sky/azure blue, green-ish blue a red color flesh color yellow of a chestnut color of a lemon color, or pale yellow bright red, with an orange tint Crimson or grain color water-colored blue cyan blue, a green-ish blue color the color which is more or less mixed with white and black light lilac grey a color that looks like flaxseed, linen gray is a soft hue deep, navy blue bright carnation yellow color jet white the color of an orange (the fruit) daffodil yellow pastel purple, like a lilac flower light pastel purple dark pastel purple a grape-colored purple; the color of marmote grapes orangey bronze an orange color/ but might be reddish light red, between cherry and rose of the color black metallurgic gold (Au); the color gold bright strong red or poppy red porcelain white, grey purple with crimson undertones (more red than modern “purple”; see violet); made from cochineal light purple with crimson undertones color of roses, pink, color of dry roses; a color which is red and vermilion a color similar to blood or fire, saturated and brilliant hue light ruby red dark ruby red yellow-orange an ensemble of colors, typically yellow, green and red green or green color a brilliant red or scarlet pigment; made from the powdered mineral, cinnabar brownish green, murky in hue celadon green cheerful green (similar to Kelly green), bright in hue pistachio green apple green sea green emerald green purple, of purple color (more blue,than pourpre) "

    "title": "Macroscope of the *Journal des dames et des modes*",
    "student": "",
    "content": " # {{ page.title }} This study is based on 499 images of the *Journal des dames et des modes* provided by The Morgan Library and Museum. The images were cropped in Photoshop and resized by 702x1248 pixels. In the original plates you can notice that each figure is framed with a black rectangle and also has a brief text describing the scene. For this study, I decided to crop the frame and text because they do not add any relevant information when analyzing the visual aspect of the portrayed human figures or accessories. On the other hand, it is important to mention that the images of the original plates are photographs of different sizes and taken with different light quality. Some of the photographs are also a bit cropped and tilted. All of these factors influenced the visualizations created in ImageJ and ImagePlot. After croping and resizing all the images, a spreadsheet was created in Excel to add the metadata of each image. Subsequently, the edited images ready and the metadata were imported to ImageJ as an the image sequence. Using that software I created a Montage of 25 by 20 images of the *Journal des dames et des modes.* ![](/images/macroscope/image1.png) Image 1. Montage of 499 plates Even though the Montage seems quite uniform it is possible to distinguish some patterns of color, changes on space distribution. When all the *Journal des dames et des modes* plates from 1797 to 1804 can be seen together, overall patterns in their design became apparent: almost all plates represent single figures; women’s clothing far outnumbers men’s; hats, headpieces and hairstyles get special attention. The Montage starts with the first image of the collection of the year 1797 on the top left side of the screen and ends with the the plate 499 of the An 11 on the bottom right side. The images are arranged chronologically. The first images that appear on top, are from the year 1797 and share pastel colors with costumes with brighter accents. Many of the images from An 6 and some of the beginning of An 7 (rows 3 and 4 of the Montage) depict women in lighter garments. The rows 5 to 7 correspond to the plates of An 7 where we can observe the accent of accessories and textiles in red and purple. Also, during the An 7 we can appreciate the first plates that were published regarding fashion accessories (row 7). The presence of plates that are exclusively showing accessories continues through the years with 4 plates for the An 8, 7 plates for An 9, 4 plates for An 10 and 11 plates for An 11. In the last 5 rows of the Montage besides the high presence of accessory plates we can also notice the use of darker clothes such as green, gray and blue. To make the changes through time more evident an average density visualization for each years was created. ## Average Intensity of the Images Per Year Created in ImageJ ![](/images/macroscope/image2.png) Image 2. Average intensity plates of 1797 This visualization corresponds to the plates that form the first row of the Montage (Image 1). We can note that the plates of 1797 share a common use of the space and color. The action is centered in the upper middle part of the plate, but we can notice the trace of fans to both sides of the main figure. The following year the makers of the plates made greater use of the space (Image 3). We distinguish the contour of arms and bottom part of dresses and skirts that occupy the side parts of the plates. ![](/images/macroscope/image3.png) Image 3. Average intensity plates of 1798 In the following visualizations, Image 4 to Image 9, we observe that the figures appear more as a shadow with softer lines and colors. The use of the space follows a similar pattern as in the plates published during the years 1797 and 1798. However, the amount of plates created from An 6 to An 11 was much bigger. When superimposing the images, it translates in visualizations with subtle lines. Additionally, during that time period (An 7 to An 11), the *Journal des dames et des modes* started printing plates that exclusively featured accessories. Image 9 was created combining the plates of An 11. As mentioned before, that year was the one that counted with the most display of accessories. The change is also reflected in the use of the space that becomes a bit less centered. ![](/images/macroscope/image4.png) Image 4. Average intensity plates of An 6 ![](/images/macroscope/image5.png) Image 5. Average intensity plates of An 7 ![](/images/macroscope/image6.png) Image 6.

Average intensity plates of An 10 ![](/images/macroscope/image9.png) Image 9. Average intensity plates of An 11 ## Visualization of the Collection of 499 Images Using ImagePlot Furthermore, to identify similarities and differences between the 499 plates on brightness and saturation dimensions I created a visualization using ImagePlot. In ImageJ, running the macro called ImageMeasure, I was able to obtain other information about the images such as median brightness, brightness stdev., saturation median, saturation stdev., hue median and hue stdev.. With that information an Excel document (.txt) was created and later used with ImagePlot macro. ![](/images/macroscope/image10.png) Image 10. ImagePlot visualization of 499 plates of the *Journal des dames et des modes* from 1797 to 1804 X-axis = brightness median. Y- axis= saturation median. The plates of the Journal des dames et des modes turn out to be quite consistent in their design, indicating a single, decisive editorial vision. This visualization (Image 10) creates a main rectangular cluster of images that have similar brightness and saturation. Most of the images are located in the lower right side of the space which means that they share a medium to high brightness value and a low to medium saturation. Many of the 499 images that are part of this representation share the same brightness and saturation values and appear to be superimposed over each other. The main cluster of images is not symmetrical and the bottom left side seem denser with a higher number of plates. From the 499 images used to create this visualization there is only one plate that is very different from the rest. It is a plate that was published during the An 8 and depicts a woman lying on a bed. The image has a low brightness median and a very high saturation. Moreover, it is possible to identify how different fashion styles or characters shared similar brightness and saturation values. To make this more evident the last two images of this project are a detailed view of the ImagePlot visualization of 499 plates of the *Journal des dames et des modes.* In Image 11, we can recognize how most of the the plates that represent male figures are closer in brightness and saturation values. Most of men are represented wearing darker clothes and stronger colors. Something similar happened with the plates of women accessories represented in Image 12. The group of images that depict accessories share a higher level of brightness than most of the plates. ![](/images/macroscope/image11.png) Image 11. Detail of image 10, plates that portrayed male figures. ![](/images/macroscope/image12.png) Image 12. Detail of image 10, plates that illustrate accessories. The result of the visualizations of the average intensity of the plates per year and the one analyzing the brightness and saturation show several similarities. Specifically, it is possible to talk about the existence of a distinctive style in the *Journal des dames et des modes.* The existence of one big group of images that have comparable brightness and saturation values and create one main cluster tell us that during the years of the publication there were aesthetic standards that were maintained. We can recognize that the Journal cultivated a distinguished signature approach that had similar characteristics, like the use of the space, and color palette through the years and through many different plates makers. --- ## Bibliography Manovich, Lev.

    "student": "",
    "content": " Paris vs. London Many of the fashions depicted in the Journal des dames et des modes from 1797-1804 are strikingly radical and uniquely Parisian. Comparing JDM plates to fashions from British journals printed in London reinforces these claims, but also shows commonalities between the two warring countries. The infographic below (click to enlarge) draws comparisons between JDM and two British journals: Gallery of Fashion: Published from 1794 to 1803 by Nicholas Heideloff. Two plates featuring 1-3 figures each appeared monthly with accompanying descriptions. The Fashions of London and Paris: Published monthly from 1798 to 1806 with 2-3 plates of London fashions. Almost every month also included a plate titled 'Parisian Fashions' that directly copied fashions from the JDM with minor changes. It is notable that fashion plates from these two British journals only depicted women's fashions during this period, never men, and the female figures rarely appeared alone. Even when The Fashions of London and Paris copied JDM plates, they arranged two or more figures on the page - it would be highly improper for a woman to be out and about on her own! All images of the Gallery of Fashion are from the collection of the Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. All images of the The Fashions of London and Paris: are the author's own taken at the Yale Center for British Art. "

    "title": "Underpinnings or the lack thereof",
    "student": "",
    "content": " Supporting a Revolution: Underpinnings or the lack thereof No More Underwear! Women’s clothing before the Directoire phase of the French Revolution, that is before around 1795, relied on a complex architecture of petticoats, panniers, pads, and stays. These underpinnings were typically rigid and inflexible because they were constructed using stiffening tools such as whalebone (baleen), reed, and metal – hence the English word “stays”. As the Journal des dames et des modes dramatically reveals, however, in a scant two years, by 1797, fashionable French women had staged an underwear revolution of their own. They both abandonned traditional undergarments, and adopted sheer, if not transparent, fabrics for clothes which were a fraction as full as they had been. Until 1804, when women’s fashion began a twenty-year return to earlier norms, the female form was publicly visible. New Look The popularity of new silhouettes changed everything. As skirts rose to right under the bust, there was no longer a need for stays to winnow away the waist. New styles strove to achieve a “natural” silhouette, which required underpinnings which would not deform women's natural shape. This called for new materials and advances in construction. One such technology is the advent of 'metal elastique,' a rigid, yet expandable material made from tightly coiled metal wires. This clever application of mechanical materials to undergarments can be attributed to the 1763 patent of the coiled spring, and can also be seen used in jewelry depicted in the Journal. Corset styles Inspiration changed quickly and was taken from whatever novelty was trending at the moment. Whether it was political, historical, or theatrical- nothing was off limits to influence women's dress. In this plate, we see the 'Lisbeth corset' so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favieres and Gretry comic opera. These styles, though dubbed as 'corsets' by the Journal, were terms used somewhat interchangeably with 'bodice' and served more decorative purposes, rather than as support garments. Soon, women's underpinnings began to migrate from underclothing to outer clothing. The Sexuality of Underwear For most observers, though not all, women’s Directoire and Consulat rebellion against traditional underwear signalled a radical revolution in morality. No one had expected women would cease wearing petticoats or stays, and many people were shocked by the sexuality of this choice. The effect was very much reinforced by how narrow and light women’s clothing became. Yet the Journal des dames et des modes did not hesitate to depict what it noticed in Paris: women whose bodies were revealed, not reshaped or concealed, by their clothing. All of Europe paid attention. With the advent of the First Empire in France, however, the underwear pendulum began to swing back, and the Journal des dames et des modes with it, until by the 1820s, all European women were once again wearing underpinnings as restrictive as they had before 1795.
